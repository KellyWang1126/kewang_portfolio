# Ke Wang's Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of data analysis projects I've completed using tools like SQL, Python, R, Excel, and Power BI. Each project focuses on different stages of the data analysis process, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and visualization. Below is a summary of each project.

## 1. Layoff Data Analysis with SQL

**Objective**:  
This project focuses on cleaning raw layoff data to make it suitable for analysis, followed by an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in layoffs across industries and regions.

**Key Tasks**:
- Data cleaning: Dealt with missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats, dropped unnecessary columns.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Generated insights into layoff by computing statistical measures.

## 2. Digital Marketing Campaign Dashboard with Power BI

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize digital marketing campaign spending and key performance indicators (KPIs) across various channels.

**Key Tasks**:
- KPI calculations: Computed marketing performance metrics (conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, etc.).
- Dashboard creation: Built an interactive dashboard with slicers, graphs, and cards.

## 3. Shopping Trend Data Analysis with Excel

**Objective**:  
This project involved cleaning and analyzing shopping preference data to reveal consumer trends and patterns in spending behavior.

**Key Tasks**:
- Data cleaning: Handled duplicates, missing values and standardized data.
- Data analysis: Used Excel formulas and pivot tables to summarize data and find key insights.
- Visualization: Created a dashboard with graphs and slicers to display consumer shopping preferences.

## 4. Yelp Restaurant Bankruptcy Analysis with Python

**Objective**:  
In this project, data from the Yelp Open Dataset was scraped and analyzed to predict restaurant bankruptcy rates. 

**Key Tasks**:
- Data Cleaning: Identified and removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized data formats, and removed unnecessary columns.
- Feature Engineering: Defined the response variable and created several predictor variables to enhance the analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Computed summary statistics and created visualizations to uncover insights.
- Modeling: Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict restaurant bankruptcy.

## 5. Youth Mental Health Risk Factor Analysis with R

**Objective**:  
This project aimed to analyze risk factors for youth mental health issues using survey data, focusing on geographic and sociodemographic variables. We applied machine learning models and ranked variables using SHAP analysis to understand their influence on mental health outcomes.

**Key Tasks**:
- Data Cleaning: Checked for duplicates, addressed missing values, standardized data formats, and removed unnecessary columns.
- Feature Engineering: Defined the response variable, combined multiple categorical variables into one, and created a new numerical variable.
- Modeling: Applied machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to predict the response variable.
- SHAP analysis: Ranked variables by importance to gain a deeper understanding of key risk factors.
